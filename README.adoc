= Fotorelacjonusz

Fotorelacjonusz is a software for posting photo reports, an activity which is
frequently exercised by the community of Forum Polskich Wieżowców (a Polish
section of SkyscraperCity.com).  Users take photos of building sites in their
neighbourhood, and share them with others in order to show construction
progress.

== Features

. Uploading photos to Imgur.
. Composing photo reports in BB Code, and posting them to SkyscraperCity.com.

== Usage

. Add photos.
. Optionally: reorder them, write descriptions.
. Click "Upload".
. Log in to forum.
. Navigate to a thread you want to post a photo report to.
. All the rest will be done automatically.

== Previous versions

Fotorelacjonusz has been originally written in C++ and Qt by Kamil OST.
You will find the source code and original releases for Windows and Linux
systems here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fotorelacjonusz.

There was also a semi-successful attempt to update Fotorelacjonusz to a recent
version of Qt.  It brings support for MacOS, also works on Linux, but Windows
binary has never been released.  You will find the source code and binary
releases here: https://github.com/skalee/fotorelacjonusz.

You may want to use the older versions, because they have some unique features
as compared to the current one.
